# DEVTEST FRONTEND
Leave environment variables for less complexity

**Install dependences**
`npm install`
**Run**
`npm run dev`

**DESCRIPTION**
From the frontend, use react query to manage the requests to the backend, using this tool, add a configuration so that requests are made to the api every 5 seconds, so the socket data will always be updated, I could not implement the search by date by time issues.
